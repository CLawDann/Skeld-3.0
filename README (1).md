# Bricktops by OrbitalOwen (Custom Map for Bad Business)
The following repository you're seeing here is made and optimized for a Roblox game called, Bad Business. Here you'll see that there is a set of numbers and letters existing within a "custom map" that is supposed to be played. In which it is played by clicking on a map's RAW and copying it's URL, and pasting it to the game's importmap feature.

# How it works
1. You firstly want to go to Roblox Studio to setup your custom map first.
2. Secondly, with the plugin you possess, press the "new" button to make a brand new custom map in preperation.
3. Before you actually place your KOTH objective and spawns, make sure you prepare your customly built map first, in order for the KOTH objective and spawns to flow the way you want it to.
4. Now, after you finished that, move your KOTH objective and spawns to your desired locations (Yes, you can duplicate spawns but they must be in the same folder as spawns are).
5. Move all of your bricks/models/map to geometry, in order for the plugin to render all the map pieces into one code.
6. Select the map folder once you're done, and export it to see a Results folder, in which you'll use it to copy the code and paste it into an empty file (This process will take slightly longer if your map is large).
7. Copy the code that is shown in the results script, and if your map is larger than 1 part, stack them from top to bottom in terms of code.
8. Make a new repository and a new file, then paste your entire code provided from the plugin to the file, while naming everything at the same time.
9. Commit your changes, then go to the file, and it's RAW. (THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD START FOLLOWING IF YOU PLAN TO PLAY THIS MAP)
10. Copy the RAW link, and go to Bad Business.
11. (THIS IS REQUIRED FOR IT TO FUNCTION, AND FOR YOU TO TEST THIS OUT) Make a personal private server if you haven't (it's free), then join in your private server to test it out.
12. Copy the RAW URL, then open up console by pressing F6.
13. Type the following command: "admin_importmap", and then paste your RAW URL link next to it.
14. If successful, the console will tell you that the import process worked, and you'll have to tell the console that you want your custom map to be played next just to verify it.
15. To do so, you simply type: "admin_stemap", and whatever your custom map's name is (it's usually custom_Map). Afterwards, you're done! Enjoy your custom map!
